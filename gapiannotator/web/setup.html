            This application allows you to automatically tag your images using the Google API and store the tags in the metadata of the images. It offers the following features:
            <ul>
                <li>Tagging based on the image content: cloud, water, animals, cars, wheels, Eifel tower, company logos, dominant colors, ...</li>
                <li>Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on text within the image, will also be stored as a label.</li>
                <li>Reverse geocoding: add location (town, region, country) if the image has a GPS tag.</li>
                <li>All labels can be translated to a desired language.</li>
                <li>Face detection, whereby the faces can easily be named using the Web GUI.</li>
                <li>Lossless rotation of images according to their EXIF orientation tag.</li>
                <li>While running, given folder will continuously be watched for new images to automatically process them.</li>
                <li>If running on a Synolgy NAS: automatically create synolgy thumbnails, faster than the buildin method. All changes will automatically pushed to the indexing service.</li>
                <li>Automatic synchronization between simultaneously used Web GUI instances using websockets. This allows, for example, that multiple users can name faces in parallel.</li>
                <li>The Web GUI is optimized for desktop as well as mobile usage.</li>

            The software allows the modification of images, especially their metadata. 
            The functionality has been extensively tested, but errors can never be excluded. 
            Therefore I would like to point out again that no responsibility is taken, including 
            but not limited to data loss, or even if the world ends.

            First, you need a 
                <a target="_blank" href="https://developers.google.com/">Google Developer account</a>
                and have to create a
                <a target="_blank" href="https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production#create_service_account">service account</a> (credentials file)
                as well as an 
                <a target="_blank" href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key#creating-api-keys">API key</a> (stored in a file).

        Furthermore you need to activate the follwing APIs: 
            <a target="_blank" href="https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/google/vision.googleapis.com">Cloud Vision</a>,
            <a target="_blank" href="https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/google/translate.googleapis.com">Cloud Translation</a>, and

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col col1">
        Google APIs have free contingent per month, which should be enough for most users. Here you can find pricing details for the used APIs:

            <a target="_blank" href="https://cloud.google.com/translate/pricing">Translation</a>, and

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col col1">
        Note: to validate the API key, the credentials file, and that the required APIs are activated, a test request will be sent for each.
